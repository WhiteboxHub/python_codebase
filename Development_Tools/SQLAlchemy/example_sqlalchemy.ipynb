    "### Explanation of SQLAlchemy ORM Approach:\n",
    "ORM (Object-Relational Mapping): You define a User class, which is mapped to the users table in the database. This eliminates the need to write raw SQL queries for operations like inserting or querying data.\n",
    "SQLAlchemy Engine: The engine handles the low-level details of interacting with the database, such as managing connections and transactions.\n",
    "Session Management: SQLAlchemy handles session management (starting and committing transactions), which is more convenient than manually managing transactions in a traditional JDBC-like approach.\n",
    "Queries with Python Objects: You can query the database using Python objects instead of writing SQL queries. For example, session.query(User).all() retrieves all users without needing to write a raw SQL SELECT query.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of Using SQLAlchemy:\n",
    "Abstraction of SQL: SQLAlchemy abstracts raw SQL queries and provides an object-oriented approach, reducing boilerplate code.\n",
    "Ease of Use: Writing queries and managing database connections becomes easier using the ORM.\n",
    "Automatic SQL Generation: You don't need to manually write SQL queries for common operations (e.g., INSERT, SELECT).\n",
    "Database-Agnostic: SQLAlchemy supports various databases, such as SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc., making it easy to switch databases without changing much code.\n",
    "Relationships and Foreign Keys: SQLAlchemy allows you to easily define relationships between tables (e.g., One-to-Many, Many-to-One) without having to write complex joins.\n"
